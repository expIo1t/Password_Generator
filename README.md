# Password_Generator

The program **generates a random password of high complexity** and prints it to the console. 
By default, the password is 30 characters long, containing at least *one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character*.

You can **customize the length of the password** by providing an argument to the *generate_strong_password* function. 
For example, to generate a password of length 20, modify the function call as follows: 

<pre>
password = generate_strong_password(20)
</pre>
